# Minesweeper

This is my second attempt at recreating this game. This time I used the Proccesing library, rather than Java Swing. I included the nessesary package.

right clicking the smiley face resets the game with the same layout and does not reset the stopwatch

left clicking the smiley face generates a new layout and resets the clock
